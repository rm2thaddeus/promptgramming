# Phase 1 - Ideation

## Purpose
Translate the main idea into structured concepts, actionable goals, and clear scope boundaries.

## Key Activities
- **Goal Refinement**: Convert the main idea into concrete, measurable objectives
- **Scope Definition**: Establish what's in-scope and out-of-scope
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify assumptions and potential risks

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 0: `PROFILE.yaml` and `CONTEXT.md` with main idea defined

## Deliverables
- `IDEA_NOTE.md` — Structured idea with goals, scope, and risks

## Agents Quick Start
- Open `docs/Phase1-Ideation/agents.md`.
- Use the Prompt Starter to propose a measurable objective, 2–3 goals, and 2–3 metrics.
- Draft scope (in/out) and top risks; update `IDEA_NOTE.md` minimally.
- Confirm readiness for Phase 2 against the Success Criteria.
