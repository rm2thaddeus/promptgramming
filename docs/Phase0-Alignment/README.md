# Phase 0: Alignment

## Purpose
Establish collaboration norms, infer user profile, and define the main project idea through structured conversation.

## Key Files
- `PROFILE.yaml` - User profile and collaboration preferences
- `CONTEXT.md` - Project background, constraints, and main idea

## Process
1. **User Discovery**: Ask about editor, OS, experience, and communication preferences
2. **Style Inference**: Analyze prompting expertise and decision-making patterns
3. **Idea Articulation**: Help formulate a clear, one-sentence project objective
4. **Profile Building**: Document collaboration contract and observed patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User profile captured in PROFILE.yaml
- [ ] Project context documented in CONTEXT.md
- [ ] Clear main idea articulated in one sentence
- [ ] Collaboration preferences established

## Next Phase
Move to Phase 1 (Ideation) to refine the idea into structured goals and assumptions.
