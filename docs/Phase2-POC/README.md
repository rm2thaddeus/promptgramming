# Phase 2 - Proof of Concept (POC)

## Purpose
Research feasibility, test architecture options, validate dependencies, and sketch UX/UI elements.

## Key Activities
- **Feasibility Research**: Can we build it? What are the dependencies?
- **Architecture Design**: Sketch system components and data flow
- **Technology Spikes**: Test critical components and integrations
- **UX/UI Planning**: Define user personas and journey

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 1: `IDEA_NOTE.md` with clear objectives and scope

## Deliverables
- `POC_PLAN.md` — Research findings, architecture, spikes, and implementation plan

## Agents Quick Start
- Open `docs/Phase2-POC/agents.md`.
- Summarize feasibility and dependencies; add references.
- Propose candidate stack, smallest E2E slice, and 1–2 spikes with criteria.
- Update `POC_PLAN.md` and check Success Criteria for Phase 3 readiness.

## Base Prompt
```text
Move to Phase 2. Research feasibility, architecture options, and dependencies.
Output: populate POC_PLAN.md with findings, candidate stacks, and risks.
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feasibility questions answered
- [ ] Candidate technology stack identified
- [ ] Architecture diagram sketched
- [ ] 1-2 technology spikes planned with success criteria
- [ ] User personas and journey defined
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigation strategies
