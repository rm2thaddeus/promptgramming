# Phase 2: Proof of Concept (POC)

## Purpose
Research feasibility, dependencies, architecture, UX sketch, and conduct technical spikes.

## Key Files
- `POC_PLAN.md` - Research notes, architecture, and experimental results

## Process
1. **Feasibility Research**: Investigate core dependencies and constraints
2. **Architecture Design**: Sketch system components and data flow
3. **Technical Spikes**: Prototype risky or unknown components
4. **UX Planning**: Define personas, user journeys, and wireframes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Core dependencies validated
- [ ] Architecture sketched and documented
- [ ] Technical risks identified and mitigated
- [ ] UX approach defined

## Next Phase
Move to Phase 3 (MVP) to implement the working prototype.
